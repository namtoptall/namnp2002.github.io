I)      Personal information:
>>> Name: Nguyen Phuong Nam
>>> Student number: 3877256
>>> Email: namnp2002@gmail.com
>>> Personal information: Born in 2002, 18 years old and have just arrived in Saigon from Hanoi in late October. I come from Vietnam, so my mother tongue language is Vietnamese and also, I use English in academic study, probably it will be used in my career life in the future. Specifically, I am a football enthusiast. I usually spend loads of time watching football matches and hours exploring those matches, looking for the match data analysis. Also, I read scouts about young talents periodically in order to improve my knowledge in this field because I believe that football is not only some performance in games or club's problems but is it more complicated, related to management system, statistics and it is an extremely large part of entertaining nowadays. My favorite club is Manchester United, a team that has gone past their prime since the retiring of Sir Alex Ferguson, a legendary manager who makes United become a glorious club himself. When people meet me for the first time, they always guess that I am a shy, inaccessible person who takes every single thing seriously mostly because of my old, inconvenient face until I open my mouth. In contrast, long-term relationships will assume that they fell comfort with me due to my hilarious, kind and up to a point, stubbornness. As a turbulence boy, I believe in only myself with life goals and no one can change it. My feelings transform frequently during the day. However, I also have the ability to keep calm even though there are some troubles.
	
II)  	Interest in IT:             
1) As I mentioned before, football and Manchester United play an important role in my daily life, they contribute to my IT interest enormously. Two years ago, my favorite club was going through a sloppy time when their performance was below demand, I wondered how my club had modified. Immediately, I did some research for some possible explanation. It was the time that I found a blogger named Jason.W. Ke. Despite the fact that he had a coach license from The Football Association, Jason improved himself in the underground football world, introducing his real dark scenario about everyday-life situations, not only his knowledge in management. By his realistic thoughts, it dawned on me that the way Manchester United being maintained was totally rubbish, their chief executive officer did not pay attention to their strength but only to the profit their bosses could gain. I started to be interested in data analysis then and studying information technology is the best way to expand my ability in such an area. 
2) Obviously, RMIT is one of the most prestigious multinational universities in the world with a global license so (not to mention the tuition fee) choosing RMIT would be a good choice for me. This story began from my extremely long Tet holiday, when I spent days learning guitar and playing games then I felt disappointed with my current life in Hanoi and decided to make it more challenging. As a result, I tried to improve my English in order to achieve a requirement for the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology information technology academic course. Furthermore, RMIT provides useful accounts and tools for study without additional payment, so online courses are accessible easily from RMIT accounts.   
3) I tend to expand my knowledge about coding and analyzing data during the course for my future career. In this course, a methodical way to approach the world of information technology and practical relevant skills should be learned. I want to be able to complete the course with the fulfillment in this area. Hope that this will be a memorable time for me.
III) Ideal job:
1) This is two links that illustrate my ambition (https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/data-analyst-jobs#:~:text=A%20Data%20Analyst%20interprets%20data,analytical%20nature%20of%20the%20role.) and ( https://soccerment.com/the-importance-of-football-analytics/?fbclid=IwAR3PdNOkjMSlVQ0wKN2B5r8ENBD4wQ_KvN37ViS7DuG-Yxy5HmMriLRLmpE  )      	                   	`                    
My ambition is, as a soccer fan, improving teams of my interest and working for VFF or some individual organizations that scout players and analyze football backgrounds. Furthermore, working for Manchester United, contributing to their revolution is my dream. My job will be concluding information about our rivals, scouting players in favor of the manager and most interesting, making predictions about upcoming trends. The intrigue point is I will have the ability to motivate my company through my predictions and suggestions. However, it is unavoidable that this job requires passion and responsibility because you have to persuade that your work is meaningful for its evolution. Unfortunately, my ideal job is only available periodically, so there is no advertisement at this time. 
2) When it comes to relevant practical skills, data analytics requires employees to use data query languages and statistical programming software proficiency. Moreover, you must have background knowledge that suits your field and data-driven making skill. For example, football newbies to the bosses so development is extravagance for them. Lastly, you need certification from credible Western countries institutions.      	
3) These useful skills are actually really complicated to learn. First, I have to graduate from university to achieve further education programs. Next, the best way to learn is living in the West, where they have developed data science and football background and also improve my ability to use English appropriately. Furthermore, learning practical analysis skills from seniors and trying to avoid mistakes is of equal value to accomplish the job.
IV) Personal profile:
0.	Initially, result of Myers-Briggs test and learning style test are placed in two following links:
 (http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=9&V=5&T=6)
(http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=9&V=5&T=6)
-	The third test, which was taken for me by a vocational guidance center in Hanoi and this is the result:  
Overall, the Myers-brings test and the third latter test show that I am introverted and the mediator. On the outside, Mediators (INFPs) may seem quiet or even shy. But they often have vibrant, passionate inner lives. *Because they make up such a small portion of the population, people with this personality type may sometimes feel misunderstood or out of step with the world. Fortunately, their caring nature can help them create and sustain deep relationships with their loved. Speaking in their truth and highly independence are two basic characteristics of them. Also, they are passionate, passionate, tolerant and loyal for their belief. On the other hand, sometimes, they are over materialistic, always doubting about their ability and easily emotionally driven. Lastly, it is pleasant to live with them but hard to understand them deeply. The second test shows that I am an audio learner, who prefer to listen than to read.   
1. 	Unsurprisingly, three test outcomes showed every single detail of my personality. It is undoubtedly that they are all credible tests that inform exactly how you are. However, there are some aspects that I haven’t recognized were also included correctly. Moreover, career helpful recommendations make me feel more confident about my academic plan. In conclusion, I will try to strengthen my advantages and improve drawbacks to satisfy business's requirements.      	
2. 	 I have been informed about my ability to do tasks in a group project and what is the best thing I can technically accomplish thanks to the test result. In a team, mediators usually perform as a helper. They enjoy having freedom and latitude without punishing expectations but sometimes perfecting their ideas are aimed rather than fulfilling their tasks so what they need is a leader who always keeps their work on the line. For me, I always try to develop extremely creative, insane solutions and may work on my own if teammates do not know the first thing about it. Sticking with the plan is a reasonable method for group assignment.
3.     My ideal group will be a balanced team that everyone has their own enthusiastic part, working on it and also helping each other rather than holding controversy to scold others' mistakes. Take the group for assignment 3 as an example, it should be at least one experienced not a student studying their first semester in RMIT, a connector who forms group, newbies who want to learn and perhaps a one who can summaries and conclude into a submit form. It must be facial expression to decide a plan and strictly follow it. However members can be creative as long as their idea also follows the group’s concept. Friendliness is the most important aspect of maintaining this group. My job is just working on my own part and trying to solve mental problems between others and also, if suitable, create a long-term group of friends.
